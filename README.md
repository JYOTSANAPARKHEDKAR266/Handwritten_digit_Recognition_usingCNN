# Handwritten_digit_Recognition_usingCNN

🖥️ Handwritten Digit Recognition - MNIST Classifier

📦 Project Overview
This project implements a Feedforward Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron) using PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. With proper architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization, the model achieved over 98% test accuracy, demonstrating the power of neural networks for pattern recognition tasks.

🎯 Key Features:-
Trained on the MNIST dataset (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images)

3-layer MLP with ReLU activations and dropout regularization

Automated hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

Achieved 98.16% test accuracy

Simple yet effective approach for digit classification

📊 Technologies Used:-
